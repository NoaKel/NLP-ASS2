# grammar 4 supports:
# ## a & an (a) ##
# example: a very ambivalent apple
# example: an apple
# example: an elf
# example: an ordinary apple
# For the first rule I created a Det with its equivalent Noun by extending:
# NP  Det Noun
# There are now “a” Nouns (starting with non-vowel) and “an” Nouns (starting with vowels)
# When adding an adjective I extended:
# Noun    Adj Noun
# If a noun had an “a” det the extension will take an “a” adjective/adverb (starting with a non-vowel), if it had an “an” det the extension will take a “an” adjective/adverb (starting with vowels). The new Noun could be any of the nouns (“a” noun, “an” noun).

# ## yes/no questions (b) ##
# The NP part remained the same as grammar2, the VP needs to work in a different tense.
# I added form of questions as seen in the example and derived from grammar 2.
# Now for the VP I had to create a new list of verb formation and rules to deal with question tense.
# example: did Sally eat a sandwich ?
# example: will Sally eat a sandwich ?
# example: is Sally lazy?
